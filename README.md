# DENSITY-BASED-SMART-TRAFFIC-CONTROL-SYSTEM-USING-CANNY-EDGE-DETECTION
The project aims to build a smart traffic control system that adjusts traffic light timings based on the real-time traffic density at different intersections. Using Canny Edge Detection, we can detect the density of vehicles on the roads by processing video feeds or images from traffic cameras.
